	<h1 class="pagetitle">Thought Cabinet</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Like the thought cabinet from Disco Elysium, except not at all like that. Also less interesting.</p>

	<h1 class="date">October 3rd, 2023:</h1>
	<p>AI art is conflicting. On one hand, I find it fascinating to see what it does and learn about why it makes certain decisions from piece to piece. On the other, I find its existence
	to threaten the integrity of human creativity. There are other things we could (though personally I disagree that we *should*) be relegating to AI - so why art? All of my hobbies involve art.
	A massive part of why I enjoy the hobbies I have is because of the emotion, interests, and visceral longing to create expressed in those pieces of art. There's an explicit sadness in seeing
	an AI model trained on lifetimes of effort generate what is, more or less, a competent (though soulless) artwork in minutes. And what of the wishes of the artists who enabled the 
	existence of that model being effectively disregarded? I don't want to see a future where one of the most interesting facets of the human experience is replaced by nothing.</p>

	<p>I wonder how many of these I can write before it makes more sense to split onto a second page</p>

	<p>I'm working on this at work to avoid working. My stomach hurts.</p>
